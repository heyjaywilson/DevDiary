## Summary

Not too much work done today, but I'm having trouble with integrating Core Data and #tca so I'm not too sure how to move forward with it. Might have to rethink how I'm moving between stores and such.

I figured out my issue with [1416-iHog](../06/1416-iHog.md). ðŸ¤¦ I was converting the NSSet correctly. WOW. Type safety and all that jazz.
