## Summary
Got a little bot distracted by making my GitHub repo pull in my latest blog posts. Might be kinda neat to do as I post consistently... Would I want to pull daily notes from here? Want to see how to do this in Swift... Made a Craft doc on what to do there

Today, I worked on more of a service that can do some image fetching and save it to Core Data. I still need some more time on it though. Trying to figure out how to do it in the background so that the user doesn't have to wait for it to happen.

Also updated my GitHub readme to pull in my blogs and videos. [Entry here](2257.md)
