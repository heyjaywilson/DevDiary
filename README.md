This is my public dev diary. I made a video about why you should have one. This is made to work with Obsidian. If you clone the repo, then you'll be able to launch it exactly like I use it.

>[!danger] There might be broken links due to work links not working.
> Items can also look weird because I optimize for reading and editing in Obsidian.

If you have something you'd like to talk about, then make a [discussion](https://github.com/heyjaywilson/DevDiary/discussions) for it on GitHub.

What goes in the dev diary? Anything related to cide or my development journey.

## Private files

This repo is set up to ignore local private files in the Private folder. Those need to be backed up/transferred in another way. This allows for the notes to live side by side.
